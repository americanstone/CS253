<h3>Image Crawler Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 3a)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's object-oriented fork-join framework.  In particular, in this
assignment you'll develop an app that uses Java's fork-join framework
to obtain, store, and transform images.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
a GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with
the unit tests discussed below to help test and debug your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Videos that present a detailed overview of Java's fork-join
framework are available from one of my <A

playlists</A>. <p>

<li>Good overviews of Java's fork-join framework appear <A

and <A

</ul>

Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be available
in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 3a you'll
need to do the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> Complete your implementation of <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment2b">assignment
2b</a>, taking into account my review comments.  In particular, it's
important that your <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE> and
<CODE>ArrayCollector</CODE> implementation(s) work properly since they
are used as the basis for the app in this assignment.  Please come to
office hours if you have any remaining questions about your assignment
2b solution. </li>

</ul>

<hr width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3a, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which
contains a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing and are used to evaluate whether you've correctly
satisfied this assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which contains an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your
app automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"></A> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the implementation
of an image crawler class in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler1.java">ForkJoinCrawler1.java</A>
file that obtains, stores, and transforms images.  This class uses
Java's fork-join framework to perform an "image crawl" starting from a
root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images
from an HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded
from a remote web server or read from the local file system and the
results are stored in files. </p>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  You will focus on converting this Java 7-based class to the
<CODE>ForkJoinCrawler1</CODE> class that uses Java's fork-join
framework.  Feel free to use Java functional programming features
(such as lambda expressions and method references) and sequential
streams (but not parallel streams) in your
<CODE>ForkJoinCrawler1</CODE> class implementation.</p>

</ul>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment3a/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A> folder are
provided to increase our/your confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence
of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to
detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3a is designed to give you experience programming
directly to Java's fork-join framework APIs.  Although this framework
is quite powerful, you have to keep track of various details manually,
whereas these details are handled automatically by the Java parallel
streams framework.  Therefore, please start the assignment soon and
ask questions in class, office hours, and on the Piazza discussion
forum.  As always, the app, image crawler skeletons, and unit tests
are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to
complete your solution. </p>

<h3>Image Crawler Completable Future App (Assignment 3)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java's functional programming features and their integration with
Java's completable futures framework.  In particular, in this
assignment you'll develop an app that uses Java's completable futures
framework in conjunction with Java's sequential streams framework to
obtain, store, and transform images.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
a GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with
the unit tests outlined below to help test and debug your
solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Detailed overviews of Java's completable futures framework are
available in videos from one of my <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">YouTube
playlists</a>.  </li> <p>

<li>Good overviews of Java's completable futures framework appear <A
HREF="http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture">here</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html">here</A>.
I highly recommend you get the book <A
HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern Java
in Action</A> to learn more about Java's completable futures
framework. </li> </ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em">
<A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>, which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which
contains a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing and are used to evaluate whether you've correctly
satisfied this assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which contains an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your
app automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> In this assignment you'll complete the implementation of an image
crawler class in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/CompletableFutureCrawler.java">CompletableFutureCrawler.java</A>
file that obtains, transforms, and stores images.  This class uses the
Java completable futures framework to perform an "image crawl"
asynchronously, starting from a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters
used to run the tests, images from the HTML page reachable from the
root Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or read from
the local file system and the results are stored in files. </p>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  Your will therefore convert this Java 7-based class to the
<CODE>CompletableFutureCrawler</CODE> class that uses Java completable
futures. </p>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Java's
<CODE>CompletableFuture</CODE> methods and Java sequential streams.
</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment3/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A> folder are
provided to increase our/your confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence
of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on these unit tests
to detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3 is more complicated than the previous assignments.
In particular, the asynchronous nature of Java's completable futures
framework may take some time to get accustomed to, so please start the
assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours, and on the
Piazza discussion forum.  As usual, the app, image crawler skeletons,
and unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them
all to complete your solution. </p>

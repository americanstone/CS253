  <h3>Image Crawler Stream App (Assignment 2a)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of the first part of this two-part assignment is to
    deepen your experience using Java functional programming features
    and their integration with Java sequential streams.  In
    particular, in this assignment you'll develop an app that uses
    Java sequential streams to obtain, transform, and store
    images.</p>

  <p> The code you'll write for this assignment has a GUI and runs as
    an Android app. Please feel free to use this app to help debug your
    solution. </p>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Detailed coverage of Java sequential streams is available in
    weeks 4 and 5 in our <a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs253/index.html#lectures">course
    website</a>.</li>
    <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java streams appear <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-streams-pt2-2227132.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-java-in-action">Modern
  Java in Action</A> to learn more about Java streams
  programming. </li> </ul>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 2a
    you'll need to do the following: </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Complete your implementation of <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">assignment
    1b</a>, taking into account my review comments.  In particular,
    it's important that your <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE>
    implementation works properly since it's used throughout the app
    in this assignment.  Please come to office hours if you have any
    remaining questions about your assignment 1 solution. </li>

  </ul>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2a, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils</A>
and <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>image_crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java</CODE>
  file that obtains and stores images.  This class uses Java
  sequential streams to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root
  Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images from
  HTML pages reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a
  remote web server or read from the local file system and the results
  are stored in files. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
  In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features is provided in
  the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
  file.  You will convert this Java 7-based class to the
  <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class that uses Java
  sequential streams.</p>

  <p> Undergraduate students must do the following: </p>

    <ul> <li>Implement the key methods in the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html">Spliterator</a>
    interface in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArraySpliterator.java</CODE>
    class (which was done by graduate students in assignment 1b).
    You'll need these methods for assignment 2b, so now is a good time
    to implement them.  </ul>

    <p> Likewise, graduate students (or students who are taking this
    course for graduate credit) must do the following additional work:
    </p>

    <ul> <li> Implement the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray</CODE>
  class, which will then be used in the assignment 2b's
  <CODE>ArrayCollector</CODE> class (not included in this assignment).
  Undergraduate students can ignore the <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE>
  class.  <P> </ul>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or if/else statements
    in this assignment and instead use Java sequential stream
    aggregate operations.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">here</a>
    in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers. Undergraduate students should
    implement code with the tag "TODO (graduates 1b undergraduates
    2a)", whereas students taking the class for graduate credit should
    have already completed these TODOs in assignment 1b.

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> Unit tests in the <code>image-crawler/src/test/java</code> are
  provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
  working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to use the Android
  Studio GUI to run the unit test locally on your computer, as
  described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</A>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 2a is more complicated than assignment 1 and is
    designed to deepen your experience developing apps using Java
    functional programming features and Java sequential streams.  In
    particular, the skeletons and unit tests are more extensive,
    though you don't need to understand them all to complete your
    solution.  Please therefore start early and ask questions in
    class, office hours, and on the discussion forums to ensure you
    complete this assignment successfully! </p>

  <h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream App (Assignment 2b)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java's functional programming features and their integration with
    Java's parallel streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll
    develop an app that uses several Java parallel streams strategies
    to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

  <p> The code you'll write for this assignment has a GUI and runs as
    an Android app. Please feel free to use this app to help debug your
    solution. </p>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul>

  <li>Detailed overviews of the Java parallel streams framework are
    available in my YouTube playlist <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">here</A>.
    Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
    available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6ca8KCAjj3HaworY-mqmCe">here</A>.</li>
    <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java sequential and parallel streams appear

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 2b
    you'll need to do the following: </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Complete your implementation of <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">assignment
    2a</a>, taking into account my review comments.  In particular,
    it's important that your <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE>
    implementation works properly since it is used as the basis for
    the app in this assignment.  Please come to office hours or post
    questions on Piazza if you have any remaining questions about your
    assignment 2a solution. </li>

  </ul>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2b, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils</A>
and <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll start by completing the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler1.java</CODE> file in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</CODE>
  folder.  This class applies a couple of minuscule tweaks to
  <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class so that Java parallel
  streams are used to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root
  Uri to obtain, transform, and store images.  Depending on the
  parameters used to run the tests, images from HTML pages reachable
  from the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or
  read from the local file system and the results are stored in
  files. </p>

  <p> Also in this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler2.java</CODE> file in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</CODE>
  folder.  This classes use a more advanced Java parallel stream
  implementation to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root Uri
  to obtain, transform, and store images. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    Your should convert your <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE>
    class from <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">
    assignment 2a</A> to the <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler1</CODE>
    class in assignment 2b by making minuscule changes to use Java
    parallel streams.  You'll also need to complete the "TODO" tasks
    in the <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler2.java</CODE> file, which is a
    variant of the <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler1.java</CODE> file that
    uses Java parallel streams in a more sophisticated manner. </p>

    You must also complete the collector implementation in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    file.  Graduate students should implement a concurrent collector
    using the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray</CODE>
    class implementation from the last assignment in their
    <CODE>ArrayCollector.java</CODE> implementation. Undergraduate
    students can ignore the <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE> class and
    implement a non-concurrent collector by using their
    <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE> class.<P>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
    conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Java
    parallel stream operations and functional programming features.
    </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b">here</a>
    in my GitHub repository.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> The unit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
  use the Android Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your
  computer, as described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 2b is designed to deepen your experience developing
    apps using Java functional programming features and Java parallel
    streams without the need to program the fork-join thread pool
    directly.  The skeletons and unit tests are extensive, though you
    don't need to understand them all to complete your solution.
    Please start early and ask questions in class, office hours, and
    on the Piazza discussion forum. </p>
